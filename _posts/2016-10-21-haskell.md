# defining functions
Haskell is a functional programming language. This basically means functions are first-class citizens.
Let's look at how to define a function.

{% highlight haskell %}
add x y = x + y

add 1 2
3
{% endhighlight %}

# functions are partial
In haskell, functions can be partially applied (applied with less arguments than defined)

{% highlight haskell %}
add1 = add 1

add1 2
3
{% endhighlight %}

If we apply `add` with only one argument `1`, then we get a new function `add1` which takes one argument.

# infix and prefix
In haskell, infix functions (i.e. operators in other languages) and prefix functions are treated alike. They can be transformed into each other using `()` and `` ` ` ``

{% highlight haskell %}
-- infix -> prefix
1 + 2
3
(+) 1 2
3

-- prefix -> infix
myadd x y = x + y
1 `add` 2
3
{% endhighlight %}

# let
The `let` statement provides syntactic sugar for `"defining variables"`.
{% highlight haskell %}
let x = 1
    y = 2
    add x y = x + y
in 1 + (add x y)
4
{% endhighlight %}
I put quotes around "defining variables" because x and y are not variables in other languages' sense. Instead, they are just bindings local to the statement, which is somewhat unique to haskell. The let statement can also define functions.

# closures/anonymous functions/lambdas
{% highlight haskell %}
-- the follwing are equivalent:
add x y = x + y
add = \x y -> x + y

-- the follwing are equivalent:
add 1
\x add 1 x
{% endhighlight %}

# lazy evaluation
{% highlight haskell %}
-- the cycle function
take 10 (cycle [1,2,3])
[1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1]

-- one way to define the cycle function
cycle x = x ++ cycle x
{% endhighlight %}
`cycle [1,2,3]` generates an infinite list `1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...`. Because Haskell is lazy, applying `take 10` to that list actually yields an finite list ``.

# type, type class
a type class is like a Java interface a type, a type is like a concrete Java class implementing an interface,

We use `data` to define a type.
{% highlight haskell %}
data Point = Point Int Int deriving Show

Point 1 2
{% endhighlight %}

The `Show` typeclass defines a `show` function which is used to print a data type. We can redefine this function as follows:

{% highlight haskell %}
data Point = Point Int Int
instance Show Point where
    show (Point x y) = (show x) ++ "," ++ (show y)
{% endhighlight %}

# type constructor
{% highlight haskell %}
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
{% endhighlight %}
We call `Maybe` a type constructor. Depending on the type of `a`, this constructor can end up creating a Maybe Int, Maybe Car, or Nothing.

# functors
The `Maybe` is an instance of `Functor` type class. A `Functor` is simply something that you can map on.

{% highlight haskell %}
class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- lists are instances of functors
instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map

-- maybe's are instances of functors
instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
    fmap f Nothing = Nothing

fmap inc (Just 1)
{% endhighlight %}

It's easy (or not so easy) to see that `Lists` and `Maybe's` are instances of `Functors`.

# pattern matching and erlang-like case statements
As seen above, pattern matching can be used in function arguments. It can also be used in `case` statements and `let` statements.
{% highlight haskell %}
let (Point x y) = (Point 1 2) in
    x + y

head' :: [a] -> a
head' xs = case xs of [] -> error "No head for empty lists!"
                      (x:_) -> x
{% endhighlight %}

# :kind :info :type
- `:kind` shows type information on types and type classes
- `:info` shows detailed information on types and type classes.
- `:type` shows type for instances of types, and type classes for types.
